## Skills to Build

### peer-review-agent
A peer-review agent/skill that critically reviews code, architecture decisions, and proposals. Could include:
- Code review with focus on maintainability, patterns, and edge cases
- Architecture review from a CTO/principal engineer perspective
- Challenge assumptions and push back on decisions
- Identify risks, technical debt, and scaling concerns

**Considerations:** Should be constructively critical, not just agreeable. Could have different "personas" (security-focused, performance-focused, maintainability-focused).

### argocd-status
Check ArgoCD for deployment/build status of services. Would allow AI to:
- Check if a PR has been deployed to an environment
- Verify sync status of applications
- Troubleshoot deployment failures
- Get current deployed versions

**Needs:** ArgoCD API access, possibly MCP server
