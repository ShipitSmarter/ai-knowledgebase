# Skills for Writing Product Strategy

## Summary

Writing effective product strategy requires a distinct set of skills that differ fundamentally from tactical product management. While many product managers excel at discovery and delivery, product strategy demands the ability to make hard choices, generate insights from multiple data sources, cascade organizational goals to team-level objectives, and actively manage strategy execution without micromanagement.

The core competency gap lies in what Richard Rumelt calls "the active avoidance of the hard work of crafting a good strategy." Most product organizations don't have a product strategy because their leaders are unwilling or unable to make choices among competing values and parties. True strategic thinking requires choosing what NOT to do, identifying leverage points that multiply effectiveness, and maintaining discipline to focus resources on a small number of critical problems.

Developing product strategy skills requires deliberate practice across four pillars: Focus (making hard choices), Insights (generating and leveraging learning), Actions (translating strategy to team objectives), and Management (servant leadership without micromanagement). Unlike tactical skills that can be learned through repetition, strategic skills emerge from deep study, customer proximity, cross-functional exposure, and the discipline to resist short-term pressures.

## Key Insights

1. **Strategy requires making hard choices, not setting goals** - The core skill is the willingness and ability to choose among competing priorities. "Bad strategy is the active avoidance of the hard work of crafting a good strategy" (Rumelt). The opposite of a good strategy should be a viable alternative.

2. **Four pillars define strategic competency** - According to SVPG's Marty Cagan, product strategy requires: (1) Focus - choosing what few things matter, (2) Insights - generating learning from data, customers, technology, and industry, (3) Actions - converting insights to team objectives, (4) Management - active servant leadership.

3. **Strategic thinking differs from tactical execution in time horizon and abstraction** - Strategists spend time planning where to take the product tomorrow; tactical PMs focus on where it is today. Strategy is the "how" between vision and detailed plans.

4. **Cascading strategy is about providing problems, not solutions** - Empowered teams receive problems to solve, not features to build. The skill is giving teams strategic context and objectives while leaving solution space open.

5. **Insight generation is the hardest strategic skill** - Strong product strategists cultivate four insight types: quantitative (data analysis), qualitative (user research), technology (enabling technologies), and industry (competitive landscape). This requires preparation and study before insights emerge.

6. **Three key traits distinguish product strategists** - Per ProductPlan: (1) Entrepreneurial spirit - thinking big and seeing opportunities, (2) Data savvy - finding insights through analysis not just instinct, (3) Superb communication - working across teams and explaining strategy to executives.

7. **Strategy development is an ongoing discipline, not a one-time event** - Strategies must be revisited regularly (monthly/quarterly), assumptions challenged, and adjustments made. Product managers must coach teams weekly and remove obstacles actively.

8. **Strategic skills develop through deliberate exposure** - Training paths include: studying frameworks (Playing to Win, DHM Model), practicing customer discovery, analyzing data patterns, following industry analysts, and seeking mentorship from experienced strategists.

## Core Competencies for Product Strategists

### 1. Making Hard Choices (Focus)

The foundational skill of product strategy is the ability to decide what NOT to do. This requires:

- **Prioritization discipline**: Resisting the temptation to pursue 50 initiatives when 3-5 truly matter
- **Trade-off articulation**: Explicitly stating what you're saying "no" to and why
- **Stakeholder alignment**: Getting buy-in for focus decisions despite competing interests
- **Opportunity cost awareness**: Understanding that every "yes" is a "no" to something else

> "When leaders are unwilling or unable to make choices among competing values and parties, bad strategy is the consequence." — Richard Rumelt

### 2. Generating Insights

Strategic thinking requires cultivating insights from four sources:

| Source | Skills Required | Activities |
|--------|-----------------|------------|
| **Quantitative** | Data analysis, pattern recognition | Analyzing funnels, cohorts, retention curves |
| **Qualitative** | User research, interviewing | Customer visits, usability testing, ethnographic research |
| **Technology** | Technical curiosity, prototyping | Evaluating enabling technologies, working with engineers on proofs-of-concept |
| **Industry** | Competitive analysis, trend spotting | Following analysts (Stratechery, etc.), studying adjacent markets |

The key skill is *preparation* - insights rarely appear without deep prior study of the context.

### 3. Converting Strategy to Action

Cascading company strategy to product teams requires:

- **Objective framing**: Expressing strategy as problems to solve, not features to build
- **Strategic context provision**: Explaining the "why" so teams can make autonomous decisions
- **OKR craftsmanship**: Setting team objectives that are challenging but achievable
- **Measurement design**: Defining success criteria that align with strategic goals

### 4. Active Strategy Management

Strategy execution demands ongoing servant leadership:

- **Weekly coaching**: Regular 1:1s to identify obstacles and provide support
- **Cross-team coordination**: Resolving dependencies and sharing learnings
- **Obstacle removal**: Taking action when teams are blocked
- **Learning aggregation**: Synthesizing insights across teams and sharing broadly

## Strategic Thinking vs Tactical Execution

| Dimension | Strategic Thinking | Tactical Execution |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Time horizon** | Where to take the product tomorrow | Where the product is today |
| **Abstraction** | High-level approach and rationale | Specific features and implementation |
| **Questions asked** | "Why this?" and "Why not that?" | "How do we build this?" |
| **Success measure** | Outcomes achieved | Outputs delivered |
| **Stakeholder interaction** | Alignment and buy-in | Coordination and status |
| **Risk focus** | Strategic risk (are we building the right thing?) | Execution risk (can we build it?) |
| **Skill emphasis** | Analysis, synthesis, communication | Discovery, delivery, collaboration |

### The Strategy Hierarchy

Understanding where strategy sits in the organizational hierarchy is crucial:

```
Vision (Why we exist)
    ↓
Mission (How we'll achieve the vision)
    ↓
Strategy (How we'll win in the market)  ← Product strategy lives here
    ↓
Plans/Initiatives (What we'll build and when)
```

Product strategy is the bridge between aspirational vision and concrete plans. It's the "how" that connects purpose to execution.

## Cascading Company Strategy to Product Teams

The skill of cascading strategy involves translating company-level goals into team-level objectives without losing strategic coherence or stifling team autonomy.

### The Fork in the Road

There are two approaches to turning strategy into action:

1. **Feature teams** (not empowered): Leaders provide roadmaps of features and projects to build
2. **Empowered teams**: Leaders provide problems to solve and strategic context

The second approach requires more skill but generates better outcomes through ownership and innovation.

### Effective Cascading Techniques

1. **Provide strategic context**: Share company objectives, scorecard/dashboard, and product vision with every team
2. **Express objectives as outcomes**: "Improve new user onboarding success rate" not "Add videos to help section"
3. **Set team objectives collaboratively**: Work with teams to define challenging but achievable goals
4. **Leave solution space open**: Let teams determine how to solve the problem
5. **Share learnings across teams**: Aggregate insights and disseminate to relevant teams

### What to Cascade

| Level | What to Share | Who Sets It |
|-------|--------------|-------------|
| Company objectives | The few truly critical business goals | C-suite, Board |
| Strategic context | Why these objectives matter now | Product leadership |
| Team objectives | Specific problems this team should solve | Manager + team together |
| Key results | How success will be measured | Team with manager input |

- **Competitive analysis**: Regular deep-dives into competitor positioning and strategy
- **Industry analysis**: Follow analysts like Stratechery, study market dynamics

## Common Anti-Patterns to Avoid

1. **Confusing goals with strategy**: "We want to be #1" is not a strategy
2. **Strategy by committee**: Trying to include everyone's priorities dilutes focus
3. **Feature roadmaps as strategy**: A list of what to build is not strategic
4. **Avoiding hard choices**: 50 initiatives means no strategy
5. **Set and forget**: Strategy requires ongoing management and adjustment
6. **Providing solutions not problems**: Telling teams what to build kills ownership
