# Writing Product Strategy for Viya TMS

## Summary

This research explores best practices for writing product strategy, synthesizing insights from leading frameworks (Playing to Win, SVPG, DHM Model) and curated resources from the awesome-product-management repository. The goal is to inform how Viya TMS can develop effective product strategies for its four product teams: Shipping/Consignment, Visibility/Tracking/Reporting, Freight Settlement/Rates, and Carrier Portal.

Product strategy is the bridge between vision and execution. It answers *how* you will achieve your vision by making hard choices about focus areas, target customers, and competitive differentiation. The best strategies are not wish lists of features but deliberate decisions about what to prioritize and what to explicitly say "no" to.

For Viya, with its clear company vision ("Awesome Logistics. Made Simple. Powered by Automation.") and strategy ("€12M ARR, 10,000 logistics professionals impacted"), the product strategy should translate these aspirations into specific choices for each product team about which customer problems to solve and how to win against competitors.

## Key Findings

1. **Strategy requires hard choices, not just goals** - A strategy must specify *how* you'll win, not just what you want to achieve. Your existing "Playing to Win" company strategy provides a strong foundation.

2. **Use the Playing to Win framework for each product area** - Each product team should define their own cascading choices: Winning Aspiration → Where to Play → How to Win → Capabilities → Management Systems.

3. **The DHM Model provides practical guidance** - Define how each product will Delight customers in Hard-to-copy, Margin-enhancing ways.

4. **Product strategy means saying "no"** - The best strategies explicitly exclude features and markets that don't fit, even if they seem tactically useful.

5. **Connect vision → strategy → discovery → delivery** - Strategy decides which problems empowered teams should solve; discovery figures out solutions.

6. **Talk to customers before defining strategy** - Validate opportunities with real customer evidence, not just internal brainstorming.

7. **Your existing strategy is well-structured** - The 2025-2030 strategy already follows Playing to Win format with clear winning aspiration, where to play, and how to win sections.

## Current Company Strategy Context

Your company already has a well-structured strategy using the Playing to Win framework:

| Component | Current Definition |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **Winning Aspiration** | €12M ARR in Europe, improve daily work lives of 10,000 logistics professionals |
| **Where to Play** | Enterprise (€10M+ transport spend, MRR 25k+), Mid-market (50+ employees, MRR 7k+), European B2B shippers, general cargo, manufacturing/spare-parts/life sciences |
| **How to Win** | Human-centred design, automation without complexity, customer journey exception handling, European cross-border expertise |
| **Core Capabilities** | Automation & workflow engine, UX & design, analytics, integrations, cross-border expertise, customer success |
| **Management Systems** | KPIs for ARR growth, user impact, operational excellence |

## Product Teams: Strategy Template

Each of your four product teams should develop a product strategy document following this structure:

### Template: Product Area Strategy

```markdown
# [Product Area] Strategy

## 1. Product Vision (2-3 sentences)
What future state are we trying to create for our users?

## 2. How We Contribute to Company Strategy
- Link to winning aspiration (€12M ARR, 10,000 professionals)
- Which "Where to Play" segments we serve
- Which "How to Win" differentiators we enable

## 3. Target Users & Their Problems
| User Persona | Key Pain Points | Jobs to be Done |
|--------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| [Role] | [Problems] | [Outcomes they want] |

## 4. Strategic Bets (3-5 max)
1. **Bet Name**: [Description of a focused initiative]
   - Hypothesis: If we [action], then [outcome] because [rationale]
   - Success metrics: [How we'll know it worked]
   - Time horizon: [Quarters]

## 5. What We're NOT Doing (Explicit Trade-offs)
- [Feature/market/segment we're explicitly deprioritizing]
- Rationale: [Why this doesn't fit our strategy]

## 6. Key Differentiators (How We Delight + Hard-to-Copy)
| Differentiator | How It Delights | Why Hard to Copy |
|----------------|-----------------|------------------|
| [Capability] | [User benefit] | [Competitive moat] |

## 7. Dependencies & Capabilities Needed
- Technical capabilities required
- Cross-team dependencies
- Skills or resources to acquire

## 8. Key Metrics
| Metric | Current | Target | Rationale |
|--------|---------|--------|-----------|
| [KPI] | [Baseline] | [Goal] | [Why it matters] |
```

## Applying to Your Four Product Teams

### 1. Shipping / Consignment
**Audience**: Warehouse / Logistics Analyst  
**Current Goal**: Make complex shipping flows easy. Enable shippers to plan & execute transportation flows.

**Suggested Strategy Focus**:
- **Where to Play**: Focus on the repetitive shipment tasks mentioned in company strategy
- **How to Win**: Automation that frees teams for value-added work; intuitive visual workflows
- **Key Question**: What's the "delta of wow" that makes your shipping flow 10x easier than competitors?

### 2. Visibility / Tracking / Reporting
**Audience**: Customer Service / Logistics Manager / Logistics Analyst  
**Current Goal**: Needs definition

**Suggested Strategy Focus**:
- **Where to Play**: Exception handling for high-value cargo; customer journey visibility
- **How to Win**: "Highlight what matters" philosophy; actionable insights not just data
- **Key Question**: How do you turn visibility into decisions (not just dashboards)?

### 3. Freight Settlement / Rates
**Audience**: Financial Manager / Logistics Manager / Logistics Analyst  
**Current Goal**: Needs definition

**Suggested Strategy Focus**:
- **Where to Play**: Cost optimization for €10M+ transport spend companies
- **How to Win**: Transparency and accuracy that builds trust; agile carrier management
- **Key Question**: What manual invoice reconciliation pain can you eliminate?

### 4. Carrier Portal - Invoice Routing
**Audience**: Carriers  
**Current Goal**: How can carriers easier collaborate with Viya

**Suggested Strategy Focus**:
- **Where to Play**: Partnerships based on loyalty and trust (per company strategy)
- **How to Win**: Reduce carrier friction to strengthen network effects
- **Key Question**: What's the carrier experience that makes them prefer Viya partners?

## Best Practices from Research

### The Playing to Win Framework (Lafley & Martin)
Five cascading choices that must reinforce each other:

1. **Winning Aspiration**: What is our purpose? What motivates us?
2. **Where to Play**: Target markets, customer segments, channels, geographies
3. **How to Win**: Value proposition and competitive advantage
4. **Capabilities**: Reinforcing activities required to win
5. **Management Systems**: Systems to support and measure success

*Key insight*: The opposite of a good strategy should be a viable alternative. If "we will delight customers" has no sensible opposite, it's not a strategy.

### The DHM Model (Gibson Biddle, Netflix)
Ask: "How will your product delight customers in hard-to-copy, margin-enhancing ways?"

- **Delight**: What unique value do you create?
- **Hard-to-copy**: Brand, network effects, economies of scale, unique technology, switching costs
- **Margin**: Business model that enables sustainable profitability

### SVPG Four Pillars (Marty Cagan)
1. **Focus**: Small number of truly critical objectives
2. **Insights**: Identify levers through data and customer learning
3. **Actions**: Convert insights into team assignments with strategic context
4. **Management**: Active servant-leadership without micromanagement

### Product Strategy Means Saying No (Intercom)
Avoid these traps that sneak features in:
- "The data looks good" (but does it fit the vision?)
- "It'll only take a few minutes" (scope is not a reason)
- "This customer is about to quit" (feature blackmail)
- "We can make it optional" (death by preferences)
- "Our competitors have it" (assumes they're smarter)
