## Key Insights

1. **Strategy requires hard choices** - A strategy must specify *how* you'll win through deliberate trade-offs, not just what you want to achieve.

2. **Use Playing to Win for each product area** - Cascade from company strategy: Winning Aspiration → Where to Play → How to Win → Capabilities → Management Systems.

3. **The DHM Model is practical** - Ask: "How will your product delight customers in hard-to-copy, margin-enhancing ways?"

4. **Saying "no" is strategic** - The best strategies explicitly exclude features and markets that don't fit the vision.

5. **Vision → Strategy → Discovery → Delivery** - Strategy is the bridge that decides which problems teams should solve.

## Key Skills for Product Strategists

6. **Four pillars of strategic competency** - Focus (hard choices), Insights (generating learning), Actions (translating to team objectives), Management (servant leadership).

7. **Strategic vs tactical thinking** - Strategists plan where to take the product tomorrow; tactical PMs focus on today. Strategy is "how" between vision and plans.

8. **Cascading strategy = providing problems, not solutions** - Empowered teams receive problems to solve, not features to build.

9. **Insight generation is the hardest skill** - Cultivate four types: quantitative, qualitative, technology, and industry insights.

10. **Three distinguishing traits** - Entrepreneurial spirit, data savvy, superb communication.

## Team Organization Insights

11. **Stream-aligned teams are the gold standard** - Team Topologies, SVPG, and Spotify all converge on teams aligned to flows of customer value (not features or domains).

12. **Empowered vs feature teams is crucial** - Feature teams (given output) produce dramatically different results than empowered teams (given problems). The PM role is fundamentally different.

13. **Cognitive load is the design constraint** - Team boundaries should minimize cognitive load. Platform teams exist primarily to reduce cognitive load on stream-aligned teams.

14. **Persona-based organization maps to value streams** - When distinct personas have different jobs-to-be-done, organizing by audience creates natural stream alignment (validates Viya's approach).

15. **Trust enables empowerment** - The main barrier to empowered teams is leadership trust. Building trust requires competence + character, not "cultural fit."
