## Key Insights

1. **Strategy requires hard choices** - A strategy must specify *how* you'll win through deliberate trade-offs, not just what you want to achieve.

2. **Use Playing to Win for each product area** - Cascade from company strategy: Winning Aspiration → Where to Play → How to Win → Capabilities → Management Systems.

3. **The DHM Model is practical** - Ask: "How will your product delight customers in hard-to-copy, margin-enhancing ways?"

4. **Saying "no" is strategic** - The best strategies explicitly exclude features and markets that don't fit the vision.

5. **Vision → Strategy → Discovery → Delivery** - Strategy is the bridge that decides which problems teams should solve.
