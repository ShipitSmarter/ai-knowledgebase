# PostHog Handbook: Mission, Strategy & Team Structure

## Summary

PostHog is a product analytics company that has built a distinctive operating model around small, autonomous teams. Their handbook openly documents their mission, strategy, and organizational philosophy. This research synthesizes key learnings from PostHog's approach that can inform Viya's unified product strategy.

PostHog's core insight is that they structure their company "like a series of startups" - small teams (1-5 people) that fully own a product, can ship without outside interference, and work directly with users. They deliberately avoid product management and product design by default, trusting engineers to make product decisions. Their strategy focuses on being "the source of truth for all product context" by providing every tool engineers need in one platform.

For Viya, the key takeaways are: (1) write one unified strategy first, then let team boundaries emerge from it; (2) small teams should own complete products, not features; (3) goals should be what you're shipping, not abstract outcomes; (4) engineers should talk directly to users.

## Key Findings

1. **Mission is simple and clear**: "Equip every developer to build successful products" - one sentence that everyone understands.

2. **Strategy has 4 pillars, not 20**: Be the source of truth, provide every tool, get in first, automate the iteration process.

3. **Small teams operate like startups**: Each team owns a product, can decide what to build, ships without outside interference, works directly with users.

4. **No PM/Design by default**: Teams don't have product managers or designers unless truly needed. Engineers make product decisions.

5. **Goals are what you ship, not outcomes**: They deliberately ignore "output-driven goals" advice. If you know what to achieve, write down what you'll ship instead.

6. **ICP and Persona are separate concepts**: ICP = the company (high-growth startups). Persona = the person using the product (engineers first, then PMs, then analytics engineers as they mature).

7. **Get in first, then let customers pull you upmarket**: Focus on early-stage companies, then grow with them.

8. **Transparency is a competitive advantage**: Public handbook, roadmap, strategy, compensation - builds trust and forces clear thinking.

## Detailed Analysis

### PostHog's Mission & Strategy

#### Mission
> "Equip every developer to build successful products."

**Why this works:**
- Simple, memorable, one sentence
- Clear target audience (developers)
- Clear outcome (successful products)
- Implies tools, not services

#### Strategy (4 Pillars)

| Pillar | Description | Viya Parallel |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| **Be the source of truth** | Single platform for all product context, not data spaghetti across tools | Single platform for all logistics execution |
| **Provide every tool** | All tools engineers need to debug, understand, improve products | All tools logistics teams need to plan, execute, track, improve |
| **Get in first** | Focus on early-stage, grow with customers | Focus on mid-market, grow to enterprise |
| **Automate iteration** | Use context to automate ship→observe→iterate cycle | Use context to automate repetitive logistics tasks |

#### Secret Master Plan
1. Ship every tool engineering teams need
2. Use that to speed up ship→observe→iterate
3. Eventually, automate the entire cycle

**Viya equivalent could be:**
1. Ship every tool logistics teams need
2. Use that to speed up plan→execute→track→improve
3. Eventually, automate the entire logistics flow

### Small Teams Model

#### Structure
- "Wide company with small teams"
- Each team = 1-5 people
- Each team owns a complete product
- Teams structured like startups

#### Principles for Small Teams

| Principle | What It Means | Why It Works |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|
| **Can decide what to build** | Within their product scope | Faster decisions, ownership |
| **Ship without interference** | No approvals needed | Speed |
| **No PM by default** | Engineers make product decisions | Fewer handoffs |
| **No Design by default** | Engineers do enough design | Faster iteration |
| **Work directly with users** | Until product-market fit | Better feedback loops |
| **Stay small** | Resist growing teams | Maintains startup speed |

#### Minimal Hierarchy
- Tiny exec team only handles:
  - Overall direction and strategy
  - Which products to build
  - Key people decisions
  - Cross-team initiatives (e.g., pricing)
- Everything else: teams decide themselves
- "Not a good place for territorial managers"

#### Titles Based on What You Do
- Not "Senior Engineer" but "Product Analytics Engineer"
- Seniority is not the focus
- What you do is the focus

### Goal Setting Philosophy

PostHog explicitly rejects common goal-setting advice:

| Common Advice | PostHog's Approach | Rationale |
|---------------|-------------------|-----------|
| "Goals should be output-driven" | Write down what you'll ship instead | If you know the goal, you've already figured out what to build - write that down |
| "Use OKRs" | Call them "goals", don't sweat wording | Wording stress has zero impact on what you build |
| "Measure outcomes" | If metrics aren't improving, switch to a new thing | Clearer is faster |

**Key quote:**
> "Either the team will decide on some things it should build, or they won't manage to figure out what to build. In either case, if a team knows what it should achieve, it should then figure out which things it needs to ship, and write those things down instead."

### Who They Build For

#### ICP (Ideal Customer Profile)
**High-growth startups**
- 15-500 employees
- $100k+/month revenue OR large consumer user base
- Raised from leading investors
- Not yet IPO'd

**Why:**
- Efficient to monetize
- Quick sales cycle
- Opinion leaders for others
- Strong opinions → better product

#### Persona (The Actual User)
Persona evolves as companies grow:
1. **Engineers at startups** (start here)
2. **Product Managers** (as company grows)
3. **Analytics Engineers** (most demanding)

**Key insight:** 
> "Each product should start with a single persona, usually an early person (preferably engineer) at a startup. Teams should make sure to build a really good product with PMF for that single persona."

Only serve the next persona once you have PMF with the initial one. Measure this by churn - if initial persona is churning, keep focusing there.

### Deciding Which Products to Build

#### Products They're Excited About
- Products engineers use at all company stages (persona doesn't change)
- Products with $1B+ competitor (proven market)
- Products easy to integrate for existing customers
- Products the team is excited to build
- Products customers are asking for

#### Products They're Less Excited About
- Products where ICP quickly changes to someone outside engineering
- Example: CRM (too far from engineering)

#### How New Products Get Built
1. Someone suggests an idea (anyone, not just leadership)
2. Hire an ex-founder who is technical
3. Onboard them into an existing team first
4. They build the MVP
5. Goal: figure out if anyone will use it
6. Add pricing, put on website
7. Get to PMF in PostHog's platform (5 delighted paying customers)
8. Then innovate (platform plays, new products that complement)

### Values That Enable This

| Value | Meaning | Implication |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| **You're the driver** | High ownership, no deadlines, get out of your way | Hire great people, trust them |
| **Make it public** | Default to transparency (code, handbook, roadmap, pay) | Builds trust, forces clear thinking |
| **Do more weird** | Optimize perfectly for strategy, not convention | Small teams when others don't, ship 50+ products |
| **Why not now?** | Ship today, don't wait for consensus | Doing > planning, mistakes are cheap at speed |
| **Optimistic by default** | Believe you can change the world | Required for ambitious goals |

## Application to Viya

### What Viya Can Adopt

| PostHog Practice | Viya Adaptation |
|------------------|-----------------|
| One clear mission | "Awesome Logistics. Made Simple." - already have this |
| 4-pillar strategy | Distill current Playing to Win into 4 memorable pillars |
| Small teams own products | Each team owns a complete product domain, not features |
| Engineers talk to users | Product engineers do customer interviews, not just PMs |
| Goals = what you ship | Write down initiatives, not abstract outcomes |
| Single persona first | Each product team picks ONE primary persona until PMF |
| Get in first | Focus on mid-market, grow with them to enterprise |

### What's Different for Viya

| PostHog | Viya | Implication |
|---------|------|-------------|
| Builds for developers | Builds for logistics professionals | Different persona, similar approach possible |
| 80+ employees | 30 employees, 14 in product/eng | Smaller scale, fewer teams |
| No PM by default | 2 PMs for 4 teams | PMs shared across teams, not embedded |
| SaaS product analytics | B2B TMS | Longer sales cycles, more complex implementation |

### Unified Strategy First

PostHog's approach supports writing **one unified product strategy first**:
- Their mission is one sentence
- Their strategy is 4 pillars
- Products emerge from strategy, not the other way around
- Teams are assigned to products after products are defined

**Recommendation for Viya:**
1. Write unified Viya product strategy (one document)
2. Identify 4-5 natural product domains from the strategy
3. Assign small teams to each domain
4. Each team owns their domain end-to-end

## Questions for Further Research

- [ ] How do PostHog's small teams coordinate on cross-cutting concerns?
- [ ] What's the actual team composition (engineers, designers, PMs) per product?
- [ ] How do they handle the transition from "no PM" to needing a PM?
- [ ] What metrics do they use to measure team health vs product health?
- [ ] How do they decide when to merge or split teams?
