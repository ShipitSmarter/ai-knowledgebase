# Viya TMS Competitor Analysis

## Summary

This document analyzes the competitive landscape for ShipitSmarter's Viya TMS platform in the European B2B Transport Management System market. The TMS market is projected to grow from $1.3 billion (2019) to $2.1 billion (2024) according to Gartner, driven by digitization, supply chain visibility demands, and the shift to cloud-based solutions.

Viya competes across multiple segments: against European-focused SaaS TMS providers (Cargoson, Transporeon), global enterprise TMS platforms (Oracle, SAP), visibility-first platforms (project44), and e-commerce shipping software (Sendcloud). Each competitor category has distinct strengths, positioning, and target markets.

Viya's key differentiators include its European logistics expertise with 25+ years of experience, modern cloud-native architecture, unified Plan/Ship/Track/Improve approach, and partner-oriented customer relationships. The competitive analysis reveals opportunities for Viya to strengthen positioning around mid-market European B2B shippers who need more than basic shipping software but don't require enterprise-scale complexity.

## Key Findings

1. **Market is fragmenting by use case**: TMS market is splitting into specialized segments - visibility platforms, freight marketplaces, e-commerce shipping, and traditional TMS. Viya's unified approach is both a differentiator and a positioning challenge.

2. **European focus is a competitive advantage**: Transporeon, Cargoson, and Sendcloud all emphasize European market expertise. Viya's 25+ years of European logistics experience positions it well against US-centric enterprise solutions.

3. **AI/ML is becoming table stakes**: project44, Transporeon, and Sendcloud all prominently feature AI capabilities. Viya should consider how to message and develop AI/ML features.

4. **Pricing transparency varies widely**: Cargoson (€199-599/month) and Sendcloud (transparent tiers) offer clear pricing. Enterprise players like Oracle and project44 use custom pricing. Viya's €2,750/month Business Standard positions it in the mid-market.

5. **Visibility and real-time tracking are core expectations**: project44 built a $2.7B business primarily on visibility. All competitors now offer real-time tracking as a baseline feature.

6. **Network effects matter**: Transporeon connects 1,500+ shippers with 180,000+ carriers. project44 connects 240,000+ carriers. Carrier network size is a competitive moat.

7. **E-commerce vs B2B distinction is important**: Sendcloud targets e-commerce with parcel shipping focus. Viya targets B2B with multi-carrier, multi-modal capabilities. Different markets with some overlap.
