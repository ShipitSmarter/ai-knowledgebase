## Creating a New Project

1. Use the `/research` command with a new topic
2. The agent will suggest a project name
3. Confirm or provide your own name
4. Research files will be created in the new project folder

## Projects

<!-- This section is auto-updated by the research agent -->

| Project | Description | Documents | Last Updated |
|---------|-------------|-----------|--------------|
| *No projects yet* | Use `/research <topic>` to start | - | - |

## Best Practices

### Naming
- Use lowercase with hyphens: `ai-agent-memory`
- Be specific but concise
- Avoid dates in project names (dates go in filenames)

### Organization
- One topic per research file
- Use `_index.md` to track project progress
- Link related research across projects

### Sources
- Always include URLs
- Prefer primary sources
- Note when sources conflict
