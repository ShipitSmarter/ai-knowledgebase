# Marketing Content Writing Best Practices

## Summary

Marketing copywriting is "the art and science of strategically delivering words that get people to take action" (Copyblogger). Effective copy isn't about following rigid formulas but about deeply understanding your customer—their pain points, desires, and decision-making process. The best copywriters use proven frameworks as scaffolding, not as paint-by-numbers solutions.

This research synthesizes insights from leading copywriting authorities including Joanna Wiebe (Copyhackers), Henneke Duistermaat (Enchanting Marketing), and usability research from Nielsen Norman Group. Key finding: **what you write matters more than how you write it**—understanding your customer enables words to flow naturally.

## Key Findings

1. **PAS (Problem-Agitate-Solution)** is considered "the most reliable sales formula ever invented" (Dan Kennedy) because people act more to avoid pain than to gain benefits
2. **AIDA's first "A" (Attention) is often unnecessary** on websites—visitors already clicked through, so focus on Interest and Desire instead
3. **FAB (Features-Advantages-Benefits)** reminds copywriters to translate technical specs into emotional outcomes customers actually care about
4. **Lower-literacy users make up 30% of web users**—simplified copy (6th-8th grade level) improves outcomes for ALL users, not just lower-literacy ones
5. **Cialdini's 6 principles of persuasion** (Reciprocity, Scarcity, Authority, Consistency, Liking, Social Proof) remain foundational for ethical persuasion
6. **AI-assisted writing pitfalls** include generic "AI voice," lack of specificity, and missing authentic voice—AI works best as a research/drafting partner, not a replacement

## 1. Copywriting Frameworks

### Primary Formulas

#### PAS: Problem - Agitate - Solution
**Best for:** Landing pages, sales pages, emails, ads

Dan Kennedy calls this "the most reliable sales formula ever invented" because people act more to avoid pain than to gain benefits.

| Step | Purpose | Example (Weight Loss) |
|------|---------|----------------------|
| **Problem** | State the problem they feel | "Tired of diets that don't work?" |
| **Agitate** | Poke at it until visceral | "Every failed diet chips away at your confidence..." |
| **Solution** | Present your answer | "Our approach works with your body, not against it" |

**Variation - PASD:** Problem → Agitate → Discredit other solutions → Solution

#### AIDA: Attention - Interest - Desire - Action
**Best for:** Traditional advertising, email sequences

The classic formula, but **adapted for web**:

| Original | Web Adaptation | Why |
|----------|----------------|-----|
| Attention | Skip or minimize | Visitors already clicked—you have their attention |
| Interest | **Critical** | Value prop that confirms they're in the right place |
| Desire | **Critical** | Benefits + proof that create emotional pull |
| Action | Clear CTA | Always include a specific next step |

**Criticism (Henneke):** AIDA's first A leads many to create flashy, distracting designs when visitors already arrived intentionally.

#### FAB: Features - Advantages - Benefits
**Best for:** Product descriptions, service pages, any feature-focused content

| Level | What It Is | Example (Fast Oven) |
|-------|------------|---------------------|
| **Feature** | Technical spec | Fast preheat system |
| **Advantage** | What it does | Heats to 400°F in 5 minutes |
| **Benefit** | Why they care | Get dinner ready on time even when busy |

**Key insight:** Customers don't care about features. They care about benefits—how you make them happier, richer, or less stressed.

### Extended Formulas

#### 4 Ps: Problem - Promise - Proof - Proposal
**Best for:** Lead-gen pages, short sales copy

1. **Problem** - State the pain point
2. **Promise** - How you solve it
3. **Proof** - Why they should believe you
4. **Proposal** - Specific action to take

#### QUEST: Qualify - Understand - Educate - Stimulate - Transition
**Best for:** High-ticket B2B, consultative sales

1. **Qualify** the prospect (ideal for statement)
2. **Understand** where they're at (show empathy)
3. **Educate** on a better way
4. **Stimulate** desire for that way
5. **Transition** to becoming a customer

#### Perry Belcher's 21-Step Sales Page Formula
**Best for:** Long-form sales pages

1. Call out your audience
2. Big promise headline
3. Back up the headline
4. Identify the core problem
5. Provide the solution
6. Show pain/cost of development
7. Explain ease-of-use
8. Show speed to results
9. Future pace (visualize improved future)
10. Show credentials
11. Detail benefits
12. Insert social proof
13. Make your offer
14. Add bonuses
15. Build up value
16. Reveal price
17. Inject scarcity
18. Reduce risk (guarantee)
19. **Call to action** (note: step 19 of 21!)
20. Give a warning
21. Close with reminder

**Key insight:** The CTA is step 19, not step 5. Don't rush the ask.

## 2. Content Types & What Makes Each Effective

### Ads (Social/PPC)
- **Character constraints** require precision
- Lead with benefit or pain point, not feature
- Single clear CTA
- Pattern interrupt to stop scroll

**Formula:** Hook (1-2 sec) → Problem/Promise → CTA

### Landing Pages
- **One goal, one CTA** - remove all navigation
- Above the fold: headline + subhead + CTA
- Social proof near CTA
- Match message to traffic source

**Formula:** PAS or 4Ps work well

### Email
- Subject line = headline (must earn the open)
- First line continues subject line promise
- Conversational tone
- PS gets read—use it for key benefit or CTA

**Formula:** AIDA or PAS, depending on relationship stage

### Social Posts
- Platform-native formatting
- Hook in first line (before "see more")
- Value-first, ask-later
- Engagement prompts increase reach

### Case Studies
- Customer as hero, not you
- Before/After/Transformation structure
- Specific numbers > vague claims
- Quote the customer liberally

**Structure:** Situation → Challenge → Solution → Results

### Blog Posts / Long-form Content
- Headline formulas (see section below)
- Scannable structure (H2s, bullets, bold)
- One big idea per post
- Clear next step at end

---

## 3. Headline Formulas

Headlines are critical—Ogilvy said 80% of advertising effectiveness comes from the headline.

### Proven Headline Templates

| Formula | Example |
|---------|---------|
| `{Product} is a {category} that {differentiator}` | "Airstory is writing software that sends ideas straight to your document" |
| `Who Else Wants {Desirable Outcome}?` | "Who else wants to look great naked?" |
| `The Only {Category} That Doesn't {Objection}` | "The only accounting software that doesn't require an accountant" |

## 4. Psychological Principles (Cialdini's 6 + Cognitive Biases)

### Cialdini's 6 Principles of Persuasion

| Principle | Definition | Marketing Application |
|-----------|------------|----------------------|
| **Reciprocity** | We feel obligated to return favors | Free value (guides, tools) before asking |
| **Scarcity** | We want what's limited | Limited time offers, enrollment caps |
| **Authority** | We trust experts | Credentials, media logos, expert endorsements |
| **Consistency** | We act consistently with prior commitments | Small yeses before big ask, quizzes |
| **Liking** | We buy from those we like | Personality, shared values, storytelling |
| **Social Proof** | We follow the crowd | Testimonials, user counts, case studies |

**7th Principle (Added 2016):** **Unity** - We favor those in our in-group. Use language that creates belonging ("Join 10,000 marketers who...")

### Key Cognitive Biases for Marketing

| Bias | Description | Application |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| **Loss Aversion** | Losses feel 2x as painful as equivalent gains | "Don't miss out" > "Get this benefit" |
| **Anchoring** | First number influences perception | Show higher price first, then discount |
| **IKEA Effect** | We value things we helped create | Configurators, customization, quizzes |
| **Mere Exposure** | Familiarity breeds liking | Consistent brand touchpoints |
| **Paradox of Choice** | Too many options paralyze | Limit options, recommend "most popular" |

## 5. Voice & Tone: B2B vs B2C

### B2B Copy Characteristics

| Aspect | Guidance |
|--------|----------|
| **Audience** | Multiple stakeholders (user ≠ buyer ≠ decision-maker) |
| **Tone** | Professional but human—avoid corporate jargon |
| **Focus** | ROI, efficiency, risk reduction, implementation |
| **Proof** | Case studies, data, ROI calculators |
| **Sales cycle** | Longer—nurture with content |
| **Reading level** | 8th-10th grade is still ideal |

**Common B2B mistake:** Writing for the company, not the human reading it. B2B buyers are still humans with emotions.

### B2C Copy Characteristics

| Aspect | Guidance |
|--------|----------|
| **Audience** | Individual (may consult others but decides alone) |
| **Tone** | More casual, emotional, personality-driven |
| **Focus** | Personal benefits, status, pleasure, identity |
| **Proof** | Reviews, ratings, influencer endorsements |
| **Sales cycle** | Shorter—more impulse |
| **Reading level** | 6th-8th grade for mass market |

### Voice Guidelines (Both)

**Do:**
- Write like you talk (then edit)
- Use "you" more than "we"
- Be specific, not vague
- Use active voice
- Tell stories

**Don't:**
- Use jargon to sound smart
- Qualify everything ("We think..." "Maybe...")
- Write in passive voice
- Use superlatives without proof
- Start sentences with "We"

## 6. AI-Assisted Writing Best Practices

### What AI Does Well

- **Research & ideation** - Generate starting points, find angles
- **First drafts** - Overcome blank page paralysis
- **Variations** - A/B test headlines, subject lines
- **Expansion** - Flesh out bullet points
- **Simplification** - Rewrite at lower reading level
- **Format conversion** - Blog to social, long to short

### Common AI Writing Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Example | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| **Generic voice** | "In today's fast-paced world..." | Add specific company voice, cut clichés |
| **Lack of specificity** | "Improve your results" | Add numbers, names, concrete details |
| **Over-promising** | "Revolutionary breakthrough" | Tone down, add proof |
| **Missing POV** | Balanced to the point of bland | Inject opinions, take a stance |
| **Repetitive structure** | Every paragraph starts the same | Vary sentence length, structure |
| **Hallucinated facts** | Invented statistics | Verify ALL claims |
| **Keyword stuffing** | Unnatural SEO phrasing | Write for humans first |

### AI Writing Workflow

1. **Brief the AI** - Provide context, audience, goal, voice examples
2. **Generate raw material** - Don't expect final copy
3. **Extract the gems** - Pull good phrases, structures, ideas
4. **Rewrite in your voice** - Human judgment, brand consistency
5. **Add specificity** - Real data, customer quotes, concrete details
6. **Edit ruthlessly** - Cut AI-isms, tighten prose
7. **Fact-check everything** - AI invents confidently

**Rule of thumb:** The less the output sounds like "AI wrote this," the better you're using AI.

## 7. Good vs Bad Copy Patterns

### Bad Copy Patterns

| Pattern | Example | Problem |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **Feature-dumping** | "Our platform has 50+ integrations" | No benefit, just specs |
| **We-focused** | "We are the leading provider..." | Reader doesn't care about you |
| **Vague claims** | "World-class customer service" | Unverifiable, meaningless |
| **Superlatives without proof** | "The best tool on the market" | Claims need evidence |
| **Jargon soup** | "Leverage synergies to optimize ROI" | Confusing, alienating |
| **Burying the lead** | Long intro before the point | Scanners never get there |
| **Weak CTA** | "Submit" or "Click here" | No value, no urgency |

### Good Copy Patterns

| Pattern | Example | Why It Works |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| **Specific benefit** | "Get 3 hours back every week" | Concrete, measurable |
| **You-focused** | "You'll never miss a deadline again" | About them, not you |
| **Social proof** | "Join 10,000 marketers who..." | Reduces risk, creates belonging |
| **Power words** | Free, New, You, Because, Instantly | Trigger attention, action |
| **Open loops** | "Here's what most people miss..." | Creates curiosity |
| **Future pacing** | "Imagine opening your inbox to..." | Visualization of benefit |
| **Specific CTA** | "Start your free 14-day trial" | Clear, low friction |

## 8. Readability & Accessibility

### Nielsen Norman Group Findings

- Users read only **20-28% of words** on a typical web page
- **Lower-literacy users don't scan**—they read word-by-word
- Simplified content (6th grade) improved success rates from 46% to 82%
- **Higher-literacy users also preferred** simplified content

### Readability Guidelines

| Guideline | Rationale |
|-----------|-----------|
| 6th-8th grade reading level | Accessible to broadest audience |
| Short paragraphs (3-4 sentences max) | Easier to scan |
| Bullet points for lists | Faster to process |
| Bold key phrases | Guides scanner's eye |
| One idea per paragraph | Reduces cognitive load |
| White space | Improves comprehension |
| Static content (no animations) | Lower-literacy users struggle with motion |
